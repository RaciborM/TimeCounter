## Project Reflection

This project was built during my Masters. It was my addicional learning and projects in web application sector.

The goal of the project was to create a web application designed to count down to an event created by the user. An additional feature is the ability to add custom graphics to the application.

The project helped me consolidate my existing knowledge and gain experience in writing code in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
